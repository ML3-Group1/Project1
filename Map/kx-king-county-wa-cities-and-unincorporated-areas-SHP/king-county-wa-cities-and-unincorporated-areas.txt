========================================================================
From: King County, Washington

Description:
  This layer is a compilation of city jurisdictional information from three
  counties: King, Pierce and Snohomish, plus the unincorporated areas in each of
  the three counties. Uses the best available information from each of the 3
  counties to produce the composite product for the jurisdictional areas and
  assumes the areas outside of the jurisdictions to be unincorporated. Updated
  whenever changes are made to any one of the source data sets. For King County
  this will be whenever CITY_AREA (parent is CITY_ANNEX) is updated to Spatial
  Data Warehouse. Pierce and Snohomish updates are shared with King County on
  quarterly to semi-annual basis. Updates are made so that the King County portion
  of this composite is synchronous with the information in the master King County
  jurisdiction layer.
  
  This layer is a component of [Administrative
  Areas](http://gismaps.kingcounty.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Administration/KingCo_AdministrativeAreas/MapServer?f=json).
  
  These administrative layers represent incorporated areas, zip codes for King,
  Snohomish and Pierce counties and tribal lands.
